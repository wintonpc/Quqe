simulated annealing
- consider tracking multiple basins (didn't bother)
- try increasing gene range. some seem to be butting up against 1/-1 (no effect, always hits max of what you allow)

look at activation functions for good genomes. are they the same? if so, hardcode and remove from genome.
(yes, tanh/gaussian split)

experiment with fitness function. try variance(doubles) * variance(sign)
(no improvement)
